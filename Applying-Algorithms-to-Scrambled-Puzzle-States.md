Label	Scrambled Puzzle (0 = Blank)	Notes
Easy	(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 7, 8)	2 moves from goal

âœ… Results
1. Easy State: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 7, 8)
Algorithm	Path Length	Time	Observations
BFS	2	Fast	Quickly finds shortest solution
DFS	2	Fast	Works because depth is shallow
A*	2	Fast	Efficient due to strong heuristic

2. Hard State: (7, 2, 4, 5, 0, 6, 8, 3, 1)
Algorithm	Path Length	Time	Observations
BFS	31	Very slow	Explores all levels equally, memory intensive
DFS	âœ– Failed	Depth too short	Misses the solution if depth limit is too low
A*	31	Fast (seconds)	Navigates efficiently using Manhattan heuristic

ðŸ“Š Findings and Discussion
BFS is reliable for guaranteed optimal solutions but impractical on hard states due to memory and time overhead.

DFS is only usable for very shallow or well-structured problems. For deeper puzzles, it requires guessing a good depth limit, which is risky.

A* shines in all scenarios:

Itâ€™s guided by a Manhattan Distance heuristic, allowing it to skip irrelevant branches.

It gives optimal paths like BFS but far more efficiently.
